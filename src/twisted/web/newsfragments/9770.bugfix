twisted.web.http was subject to several request smuggling attacks. Requests with multiple Content-Length headers were allowed (CVE-2020-10108, thanks to Jake Miller from Bishop Fox and ZeddYu Lu for reporting this) and now fail with a 400; requests with a Content-Length header and a Transfer-Encoding header honored the first header (CVE-2020-10109, thanks to Jake Miller from Bishop Fox for reporting this) and now fail with a 400; requests whose Transfer-Encoding header had a value other than "chunked" and "identity" (thanks to ZeddYu Lu) were allowed and now fail with a 400.
